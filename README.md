# Blood-Cell-Classification-CNN-Pretrained-Model


The diagnosis of blood-based diseases often involves identifying and characterizing patient blood samples. Automated methods to detect and classify blood cell subtypes have important medical application



This dataset contains 12,500 augmented images of blood cells (JPEG) with accompanying cell type labels (CSV). There are approximately 3,000 images for each of 4 different cell types grouped into 4 different folders (according to cell type). The cell types are Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, and Neutrophil. This dataset is accompanied by an additional dataset containing the original 410 images (pre-augmentation) as well as two additional subtype labels (WBC vs WBC) and also bounding boxes for each cell in each of these 410 images (JPEG + XML metadata).
